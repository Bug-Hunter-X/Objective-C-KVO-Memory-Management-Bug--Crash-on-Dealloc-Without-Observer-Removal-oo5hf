The solution is to always remove the observer using `removeObserver:` before the observed object is deallocated.  Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Access observedObject here, this is now safe after correction
}
- (void)dealloc {
    [self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
}
@end

@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObservedObject deallocated");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    MyObservedObject *observed = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
    MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
    observer.observedObject = observed;
    [observed addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:0 context:NULL];

    // ... some code that might deallocate 'observed' prematurely...
    // ...  but now it is safe thanks to dealloc in observer...

    [observed removeObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];
    return 0;
}
```
By adding `[self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];` within the observer's `dealloc` method, we guarantee that the observer is removed when it is deallocated, preventing potential crashes related to accessing deallocated memory.  Alternatively, explicitly removing the observer when it's no longer needed provides another equally effective solution.
