In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing error can occur when dealing with KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not removed properly before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is particularly tricky when the observer is a weak reference and the observed object deallocates while the observer is still in a state where it might try to access it. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Access observedObject here, which might be deallocated
}
@end

@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObservedObject deallocated");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    MyObservedObject *observed = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
    MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
    observer.observedObject = observed;
    [observed addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty" options:0 context:NULL];

    // ... some code that might deallocate 'observed' prematurely
    // ... like another object holding it releases it early ...

    // [observed removeObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"someProperty"];  // Missing removal!
    return 0;
}
```
This code lacks the crucial `removeObserver:` call. If `observed` gets deallocated before the observer is removed, accessing `observedObject` inside `observeValueForKeyPath:` will result in a crash or undefined behavior.
